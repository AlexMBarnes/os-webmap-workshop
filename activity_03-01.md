#Part 3, Activity 1
##Make an interactive choropleth map

###Introduction
In this activity you'll be using CartoCSS and TileMill to make a choropleth map of the Hungarian descended population in Lucas County Ohio by census tract. Your map will also include a legend and interactivity that informs a visitor to your map about the total and percentage of the Hungarian descended population. At the end you will export your map to mbtiles and upload it to Mapbox.

###What you will need
- TileMill
- Mapbox account (the free plan will be sufficient)
- Census tract level data for Lucas County, OH on Hungarian ancestry. (If you cloned the os-webmap-workshop repo you can find i your local copy at **/data/prepared/lucasCo_hungarian_tracts.geojson**. Otherwise, you get it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptastik/os-webmap-workshop/gh-pages/data/prepared/lucasCo_hungarian_tracts.geojson))
